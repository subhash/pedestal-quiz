=======
The Lazy Guide To Pedestal
=============

Pedestal has been in the news since it was launched during Clojure/West 2013. There have been quite a number of guides and tutorials out there:

* A todo application written in pedestal-app - http://github.com/taylorSando/pedestal-todo
* A fun tutorial to build a game in pedestal-app, by the very developers who built pedestal - http://github.com/pedestal/app-tutorial

So, why another tutorial, you ask..?


### Backstory (aka "You asked for it")

All this goes back to the long weekend many, many years ago when I learnt C++ from just a book I had borrowed from the college library. We didn't have a computer at home and so I simply started reading through the code and explanations and sort of sorted out OOP concepts in my mind as I went. It was surprisingly productive and when I went back to school, I simply started coding C++.

Ever since, whenever I had to learn a language or framework, I have yearned for a guide that would just point at code and explain how the moving parts work without requiring me to start up an IDE and code along. I realize that's a lazy approach, and hence the title! :-)


So, sit back and relax! We'll go on a tour of all the features pedestal has to offer and try to stop at points to peek inside to understand how it works as well.
